# WELCOME 

This repository is a selection of images of rust diseases assembled by plant pathologists from the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa. It is not intended to be a complete checklist of rust fungi in South Africa, but rather pictures of signs and symptoms of rusts studied or collected over several years. For some diseases, images of their microscopic nature are included. This website is the viewing platform for the Open Science Framework repository, where the images can be accessed in full: Repository of South African Plant Rust Images.
